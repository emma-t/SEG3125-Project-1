SEG3125 User Interface Design and Analysis 
PROJECT 1 - Service Business Site

This is my repository for my project 1 for SEG3125.

This project was built using HTML, JS, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.

--- 
**a) What Business Service type did you choose and why?**
I chose to do a book restoring, repairing, and digitising website because I wanted to try to make a website for a service that I don’t see very often. Repairing things that are important to people has recently been important in my life as I heard a story about a person who broke half a set of a family heirloom and was able to get a replacement made that looked very similar. I thought this would be an interesting topic and I thought that books would be a challenging idea to incorporate into my website UI (for example, the tab navigation bar).

**b) What mockup tool have you used?**
I used Pencil Project for this mockup.

**c) Which web site served as your inspiration?**
These websites are similar to my service: 
https://bookandpaperconservation.com/
https://www.bookandpaperconservationservices.com/

And I looked at these websites for the different pages and their layouts, even though they aren’t similar to my website:
https://kunstadt.com/ - home page layout
https://www.dentistryoncentrepointe.com/ - home page, contact, services, and team
https://www.ottawahairsalon.ca/ - nav bar, contact
https://halloffades.com/ - booking

**d) How do you see the navigation done on your site? Explain the storyboard**

**Home page**
- Image at the start grabs the user’s attention and gives the summary of what this service is for
- Shows pricing and allows users to learn more (redirects to the services page)
- Also shows user’s where the office is and how to contact them
- Navigation bar constantly shows the contact information, a search bar for quick access to important sections, tabs are inspired by books, the Book Now button stands out in terms of boldness and colour, and language preference is given too

**Services page**
- Allows users to see the before and after
- Uses point for to efficiently go over the key features of the service (which is best when users don’t have much time to read everything / just want to look quickly at the services)
- Bold and obvious prices
- Clicking on the card for the service redirects the user to the Book Now page and checks the service the client wants in the next page

**Specialists page**
- Shows image of specialist to show that they are people too, friendlier and appealing look for the user
- Lists experience and specialisation of the expert
- Book Now button is obvious and redirects to the Book Now page (clicking on the expert’s card will flip it and show examples of past work)

**FAQ and Reviews page**
- Shows clients feedback and answers common questions a client might have before booking the service
- Multiple reviews demonstrate that the service is used often (scroll bar emphasizes this fact)

**Contact Us page**
- Shows, once again, the location, hours, and contact information of the service and interactive map
- Also a section to send an email to the company that automatically sends an email to them

**Book Appointment page**
- The progression at the top will give a recap of all the information provided by user and shows that there are only three short steps to booking
- This progression bar also highlights where the user currently is in the process
- Allows user to select service type(s) and you cannot continue without selecting at least one (also gives small overview of service with the price point)
- The page is automatically set to any specialist and user can only choose one
- Date selector allows for manual typing or selecting in a calendar
- Time shows available time slots (does not allow users to select times that are unavailable)
- Continue button moves client to the information page

**Client Info page**
- Progression gives summary of booking so far
- Asks user for phone number (region is a dropdown menu so that only valid countries are accepted) and phone number gives example of the layout of the text field
- Email and name are asked in the text boxes below
- Additional information is clearly optional and the continue will take the user to the confirmation page

**Confirmation page**
- Booking is confirmed and says that an email and text will also be sent
- Allows users to book another service but also another button to simply return back to the home page
- Booking details recaps the appropriate information for the booking and reminds the user of the address of the company
